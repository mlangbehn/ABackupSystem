{"name":"A Backup System (ABS)","tagline":"","body":"### Description\r\nA Backup System (ABS) is a simple backup solution for Unix-like systems. Currently, only systems using GNU tools are supported. ABS may work other systems, but is not intended to.\r\n\r\nThe goal of ABS is to automate system backups as efficiently as possible, while requiring minimal user input. It does so by using crontab, cp, and rsync to create and rotate daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly snapshots of a system.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nInstallation instructions can be found on the [installation page](https://github.com/mlangbehn/ABackupSystem/wiki/Installation) of the [project wiki](https://github.com/mlangbehn/ABackupSystem/wiki).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
