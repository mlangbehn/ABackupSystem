v0.3

Most notably, the project was moved from SourceForge to GitHub.

Added Support for multiple file systems (i.e. if you have /, /var, /home, etc.
or different partitions or drives). To configure ABS to backup your other file
systems, add them to the FILE_SYSTEMS variable in /etc/backup/backup.conf --
seperated by a single space.

Updated the install script to remove old cronjobs from previous installs. This
should resolve the issue of multiple cronjobs being setup for each time ABS has
been installed/updated.

v0.2

Removed backup.exclude.
I plan on adding a check to use backup.exclude if the users adds one. I did so
to resolve issues with restoring from a backup that had excluded part of the
file system. As a result, backups will take a little longer, and take up more
space. In order to do so, I changed the flags used by rsync. I removed both the
'exclude-file' and 'delete-excluded' and added -x (making the used flags '-xav
--delete').

Added new script 'backup_restore'.
Usage: 'backup_restore /path/to/backup/to/restore/from'
Doing so will completely revert to the desired backup. Since previous versions
used an exclude file, it is not recommended to choose one to restore from, as
doing so will remove parts of your file system (everything listed in
/etc/backup/backup.exclude).

v0.1.1:

A few fixes including correcting a spelling mistake in the README, syntax
error in install.sh, and improper spelling of 'backup.exclude' in backup.conf.
Also added new command: backup_now

backup_now is not added to crontab, but it can be called at any time to create
a current snapshot (useful after initial setup and before/after configuration
changes). If a backup name is given (i.e. backup_now thisIsMyBackupName) it
will use that, otherwise it will default to 'backup-yymmdd'.

Initial Release:

First release of A Backup System (ABS).
